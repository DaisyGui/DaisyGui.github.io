This is a dataset on airbnb in NYC. Only entire home/apt in Bronx is filtered. 

```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)

airbnb_df = nyc_airbnb %>%
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Bronx",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt", 
    price < 1000)
```

This code plots a scatter plot on review_score_location and number of views.The color represents the price. 

```{r}
plot_ly(
  airbnb_df, x = ~number_of_reviews, y = ~review_scores_location, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", color = ~price, alpha = 0.5
)
```

```{r}

```
